# Hi there, I’m Michail

I’m a software engineer specializing in **financial technology**—the systems behind banks, payments, and financial services.

My focus is on building **safe, reliable, and scalable financial software**.  
In fintech, mistakes can cost real money, trust, or lead to regulatory breaches.  
That’s why I care deeply about engineering practices that prioritize correctness, resilience, and domain understanding.  

I believe software engineers should be empowered not just with tools and frameworks,  
but with **real domain knowledge**—so they don’t have to learn critical concepts the hard way.

## Why Fintech?

Many engineers entering the financial world have to reverse-engineer how payments,  
ledgers, fraud systems, or regulatory controls work. I’ve experienced this firsthand.  

It slows innovation, creates avoidable errors,  
and leads to everyone solving the same problems again and again.  

I’m on a mission to **bridge that knowledge gap**—and help engineers level up faster.

I also write about **patterns, architectures, and design principles** for fintech systems—  
and I’m currently working on a book for software engineers building financial applications.
