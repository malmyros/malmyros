### Hi there my name is Michail Almyros

I am individual passionate about Artificial Intelligence as in the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. 
I study a number of different disciplines such Maths, Search and Planning through tree search algorithms, 
Machine learning and Deep Learning, Reinforcement learning and Causal Inference.

Each discipline is fascinating and has it merits. By studying each one of them I can explore what is possible and how one can benefit the other. I see the creation of intelligent machines as an enabler that can help us advance and prosper for our benefit but for theirs as well rather than a relationship of master and a slave.

Moving towards a new age we are going to need all the help that we can to reason with our ever changing world.
